# Map Editor Keyboard

When in 3D mode, almost all of the keys modify things your mouse cross hairs are focused on - clicking the left mouse button "holds" your focus on that item.

I don't like these binding. Will change soon

To Change:

W = <Not used>
A = Zoom In
S = Add Sprite
D = <Not used>

↑ = Forward
→ = Turn Left
← = Turn Right
↓ = Backward

F2 = To 2D view
F3 = To 3D view
